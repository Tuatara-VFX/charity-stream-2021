To close the year off we decided to do something special so we hosted a 3 day charity stream event on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/tuatara_vfx/videos) to fundraise for [Child's Play](https://childsplaycharity.org/), a charity that improves the lives of children through play.

Together with the community we were able to raise **$7,132.65** dollars for this great cause!

If you missed our live event don't worry, all the videos are still available on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYWsrko742LB8oTLdEHOsg).
